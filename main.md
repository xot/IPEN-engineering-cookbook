# IPEN Cookbook for Privacy Engineering (COPE)

## Origin

[IPEN](https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/IPEN) is the Internet Privacy Engineering Network founded by the EDPS (European Data Protection Supervisor). The idea for this cookbook was launched at the [IPEN Workshop, September 26, 2014, Berlin](https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/lang/en/EDPS/IPEN/IPEN_Workshop).

Lead editor for this cookbook is Jaap-Henk Hoepman, jhh@cs.ru.nl.

## Scope

The Cookbook for Privacy Engineering (COPE) is a guide for developers on how to integrate privacy and Data Protection into systems, apps, services, etc. There is also a related [IPEN Privacy Cookbook for Business Processes](https://github.com/michael-oneill/IPEN-cookbook/).

Integrating the principles of Privacy by Design into the software engineering process should take place from the start and continue through to the end of a product's life. Privacy and Data Protection can be considered as much like other Non-Functional-Requirements such as security and performance. Engineers, business and product managers, compliance and legal aspects all apply and should have a fluid involvement. 

As part of regulatory compliance functions, the executive team in the business should mandate policy and execution of Privacy By Design or Data Protection requirements. They should also be provided with information on how it is taking place, its impacts on the business, its influence on innovation and so on. Regulators will look across the business, roles and responsibilities when assessing a business's general compliance levels and governance by the executive will be a seen as a key driving force in the Data Protection elements of any engineered product or service.

As such this cookbook will look at how Privacy by Design can be practically applied to the engineering process and lifecycle - including importantly, the testing phases - and also how it can be applied for hardware and software products, services, components, networks, systems, data management, bigdata and analytics, (?). Where useful, sections will have relevant examples.

The core contributions to the cookbook should be descriptions of generic, privacy friendly, solutions to a recurring problem. These are sometimes called privacy design patterns. These design patterns are listed below in the most relevant application area where the problem they solve typically arise.
